Feature: Customer fields synchronization
  - As a store owner
  - I want to synchronize customers additional details to Smaily
  - So I can send personalized messages and target subset of my subscribers

  Entities:
    Newsletter Subscriber - Email address in MagentoÂ´s newsletter subscribers list. Newsletter
      subscriber can have subscribed and unsubscribed status.
    Customer - A person who has created an account in store.

  Background: Store owner has enabled Newsletter Subscribers synchronization

  Scenario: Store owner has not selected any fields
    Given no fields are selected
    When Newsletter Subscribers are synchronized
    Then Customer fields are not synchronized

  Scenario: Store owner has selected field(s)
    Given Store owner has selected <field>
    And Customer has <field> set as <value>
    When Newsletter Subscribers are synchronized
    Then Customer <field> is synchronized as <value>

    Examples:
      |       field         |       value                         |
      | Subscription Type   | Constant customer                   |
      | Customer Group      | Magento customer group name         |

  Rule: All selected fields are initialized with empty value
    Scenario: Store owner has selected field(s) that does not have value set in Magento
      Given Store owner has selected <field>
      And Customer does not have value for the <field>
      When Newsletter Subscribers are synchronized
      Then Customer <field> is synchronized as <value>
