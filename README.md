# Sendsmaily Sync for Magento
A [Magento](http://magento.com/ "eCommerce Software & eCommerce Platform Solutions | Magento") extension that allows you to export newsletter subscribers from your Magento administration interface to [Sendsmaily](https://sendsmaily.com/ "Sendsmaily").

**NOTE!** One of the most noticeable shortcoming of the extension is that it allows only one-way synchornization, i.e. subscribers can **only** be exported from Magento to Sendsmaily. It will be addressed in the next major version, after Sendsmaily has added the capability for data export through the API.
